## Projects
### Vision Language Model Based Prompt Optimizaton with Subspace Representation Learning for Few-shot Out-of-Distribution Detection


Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. Existing prompt learning methods in vision language models focus only on softmax outputs, neglecting the discriminative strength of feature embeddings. To address this, we propose a context optimization based framework that combines subspace representation learning with prompt tuning, enhancing ID-OOD separability through subspace and null-space projections. Our end-to-end learning criterion achieves strong OOD detection while maintaining high ID classification accuracy, validated through experiments on real-world datasets.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
